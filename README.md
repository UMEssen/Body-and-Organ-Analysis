# BOA: Body and Organ Analysis

BOA is a tool for segmentation of CT scans developed by the [SHIP.AI group at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (IKIM)](https://ship-ai.ikim.nrw/). Combining the [TotalSegmentator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05868) and the [Body Composition Analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32945971/), this tool is capable of analyzing medical images and identifying the different structures within the human body, including bones, muscles, organs, and blood vessels.The tool also includes functionalities for the following tasks:

- Skeleton
- Organs
- Bone Mineral Density
- Contrast Media Recognition
- Cardiovascular System
- Body Parts
- Body Tissue Composition
- Body Region Detection

## Example Segmentations

The BOA tool can be used to generate full body segmentations of CT scans:

Additionally, the generated segmentations can be used as input to generate realistic images using [Siemens' Cinematic Rendering](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/digital-health-solutions/cinematic-rendering).

## How to run?

* Set up the [environment variables](./documentation/environment_variables.md).
* Either use the [PACS integration](./documentation/pacs_integration.md) or the [command line tool](./documentation/command_line.md).

## Notes on Performance

To make an estimate on how much power and time is needed to process a study, we used the [following table](https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator/blob/master/resources/imgs/runtime_table.png) provided by the TotalSegmentator. However, for very large series (e.g. 1600 slices 1mm), the performance may be worse and more CPU power may be needed. According to our tests, 16GB of GPU should be sufficient.
